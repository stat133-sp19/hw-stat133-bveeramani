This repository contains files for the first project in Statistics 133.

The purpose of the project is threefold:
* to analyze shot data from five NBA players 
* produce a report to communicate my findings
* gain experience with complex file structures

The final report is named `workout01-balaji.veerama.md` and can be found in the `report/` directory.

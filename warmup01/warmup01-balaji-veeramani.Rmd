The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the *line segment* connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$).

In *Cartesian coordinates*, if $\textbf{p} = (p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and $\textbf{q} = (q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in *Euclidean n-space*, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the *Pythagorean formula*:

$\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}\begin{split} \textit{d}(\textbf{p, q}) = \textit{d}(\textbf{q, p}) & = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + \cdot\cdot\cdot + (q_n - p_n)^2} \\ & = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2} \end{split}\label{eq:2} \end{equation}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a *Euclidean vector*. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The *Euclidean norm*, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\ \| \textbf{p} \| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \cdot\cdot\cdot + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p} \cdot \textbf{p}}$
